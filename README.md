# Horse-racing-ticket-booking-CLI-APP-

Simulation of a horse racing booking ticket web app purely written in go language. In real life, this would be a web app with a UI and a database connected to it where multiple users can book their tickets at the same time and the booking will be persisted in a database.
Press ctrl + c to exit the web app simulation after booking your tickets.
You can execute the app in your terminal [bash terminal] using the following command: $ go run main.go
